// the legacy engine · perceiver/text/spans — real meaningful spans, not arbitrary
// fixed-size chunks. Everything built earlier this session (motif
// detection, structure tests, significance) operated on chunkWords(words,
// 40) — 40-word windows with no relationship to sentence or clause
// boundaries. That's the wrong foundation for anything above it: heat-
// tracking needs a real unit to attach activation to, coref resolution
// needs real sentence boundaries to resolve a pronoun within.
//
// Ported from eoreader5's text-organ.js::splitSentences, a real, tested
// implementation — paragraph breaks are a harder boundary than any
// terminator (a chapter heading has no period and must not glue onto the
// next paragraph), closing quotes after a terminator are absorbed, and a
// terminator NOT followed by whitespace is treated as a probable
// abbreviation ("Mr.") rather than a sentence end. Not reinvented — CLAUDE.md
// names sentence segmentation with offsets as one of the consistently
// reinvented wheels in this project family.

// Container, not content. A Project Gutenberg file wraps the work in a
// licence header, a title block, and often a table of contents; none of it
// is the text being read, and leaving it in put a chapter-number list at the
// top of a salience report earlier in this session. Knowing where the
// container ends is received knowledge ABOUT THE FILE FORMAT — the same kind
// as knowing an mp3 carries an ID3 header — not a linguistic rule and not a
// word set: no claim is made here about any language's vocabulary. Texts
// without these markers pass through untouched.
// ANCHORED TO A WHOLE LINE, which eoreader4.2 had and this did not. The old
// shape here was `\*\*\*\s*START OF ...[^*]*\*\*\*` — it matches across line
// breaks and depends on the trailing stars being the next asterisks in the
// file, so a book whose title contains one, or a marker PG wrote slightly
// differently, drags the cut to the wrong place. A marker is a LINE.

/**
 * NORMALISATION MUST CARRY ITS OWN OFFSET, the same law `stripContainer`
 * above already holds ("everything downstream anchors spans against this
 * offset and a strip that forgot to move it would silently shift every
 * citation") — applied to the one step in this file that used to violate
 * it. `splitSentences` collapses `\r\n`/`\r` to `\n` before it computes a
 * single offset, and until this function existed that collapse was a bare
 * `.replace()` with nothing recording where a character had been removed.
 *
 * MEASURED (the-fold POLICIES.md LP3, 2026-08-29): a real Project
 * Gutenberg file with 3,654 CRLF pairs produced a span whose recorded
 * address, taken at face value, missed its own source file by 969 bytes —
 * correct only against a private, un-addressable copy of the text. The
 * defect was not in `splitSentences`'s CHOICE to normalise (mixed line
 * endings must fold to one before a terminator/whitespace rule can be
 * language-agnostic); it was that the normalisation was invisible.
 *
 * `\r\n` -> `\n` REMOVES one character per pair; bare `\r` -> `\n` is a
 * same-length substitution. So the map from normalised offset back to raw
 * offset is a monotonic step function with one step per collapsed CRLF —
 * recorded as checkpoints at each divergence, not walked character by
 * character on every query. `toRaw` binary-searches the last checkpoint at
 * or before the query and adds the accumulated raw-ahead-of-normalised
 * delta. Verified against the actual case that found this: a span at
 * normalised offset 196 in that file's body now resolves to raw offset
 * 1165 — the true position — via `toRaw`.
 *
 * `splitSentences` itself is UNCHANGED below: it still normalises inline
 * and returns exactly what it always returned. A caller that needs raw-file
 * addresses calls `normaliseNewlines` FIRST, passes its own `.text` to
 * `splitSentences` (which then finds nothing left to collapse — a no-op,
 * byte-identical to normalising once), and applies `.toRaw` to any offset
 * before writing it down. A caller that never calls this keeps today's
 * behaviour exactly, because nothing about `splitSentences` changed.

 * heading per line, no sentence terminator) immediately before a
 * genuinely long prose paragraph, found only within the document's OWN
 * front matter, never deep inside it.
 *
 * Built from a real, measured failure (S27; live_priors' own corpus
 * sweep, an adversarial audit of its flagged reading anomalies): a
 * Gutenberg-mirrored edition of Les Misérables carries no PG
 * START/END markers at all, so `stripContainer` strips nothing and its
 * own table of contents is never touched — it runs to roughly char
 * 21,600 before real narrative prose begins ("In 1815, M.
 * Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D——"),
 * nearly three times past an 8,000-character flat excerpt window. Zero
 * relation edges were extracted from a book that has hundreds.
 *
 * TWO SAFETY PROPERTIES, both found ADVERSARIALLY — two independent
 * skeptics verifying the first cut of this function, not its own author
 * — and both load-bearing, so both are enforced here rather than left
 * to a caller to remember:
 *
 *   - The terminator check strips CLOSING_QUOTES first. A naive
 *     `/[.!?]$/` test misreads quote-terminated dialogue
 *     ("Nor running a chance of arrest?") as TOC-shaped, because the
 *     closing quote character sits after the real terminator. This reuses
 *     this file's own received `SENTENCE_TERMINATORS`/`CLOSING_QUOTES`
 *     closed classes — the SAME ones `splitSentencesInRange` already
 *     walks past a terminator, a few lines below — rather than
 *     inventing a second, Unicode-punctuation-category regex here.
 *   - `maxScanChars` BOUNDS the search. Without a bound, this same shape
 *     (a run of short, unterminated lines) matches a back-of-book
 *     alphabetical INDEX just as well as a front-of-book table of
 *     contents — found live, firing at 94% depth into an unrelated
 *     book (a misindexed "Leviathan" file's own back-matter index).
 *     Detection never runs past `maxScanChars`, so this function can only
 *     ever relocate an excerpt FORWARD within the document's own front
 *     matter — never into its middle, and never into its back matter.
 *
 * Thresholds (70-char lines, 8 consecutive, a 300-char prose paragraph to
 * land on) were chosen by reading real specimens, not against any single
 * golden score — disclosed rather than claimed as null-derived, and
 * checked against nine independent control books (Moby Dick, Pride and
 * Prejudice, Shakespeare's Complete Works, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray, Leaves
 * of Grass, Sherlock Holmes, Alice, Don Quixote) before shipping: 7/9
 * correctly never fire, and Moby Dick's real 28KB Etymology/Extracts
 * front section — genuine prose, real terminators — is correctly
 * left alone, confirming this targets TOC *shape*, not "any front
 * matter."
 *
 * Returns `{detected, skipTo, runLength}` — `skipTo` is a character
 * offset into the SAME string handed in (never re-based, never folded for
 * newlines first: a caller composing this with `normaliseNewlines` calls
 * this FIRST, on the raw body, exactly the way `stripContainer` already
 * composes before newline normalisation elsewhere in this file).

// occurrences in the file, because every title was split off as a sentence of
// its own. War and Peace never showed it, since Russian titles ("Prince
// Vasíli", "Count Rostóv") carry no period — so the defect was invisible for

//
// WHICH tokens are abbreviations is a fact about a language, so it is not
// decided here. It is injected (`options.abbreviations`) and lives as data in
// bin/priors/lang/*.json, on its way to eoPriors. This module stays
// language-agnostic in the same way material.js does: no list baked in.
//
// When nothing is injected the fallback is derived from the material itself,
// Zipf-style, with no word list: a token type ALWAYS written with a trailing
// period is an abbreviation, since a real sentence-final word also turns up
// mid-sentence without one. A length bar taken from the text's own 10th
// -percentile token length keeps out words that merely happen to be
// text-final-only in a short sample.

//
//   - the length bar on real English prose comes out at 2 characters, so a

//   - "always written with a period" is all-or-nothing, so ONE period-less
//     occurrence anywhere — including in a licence header — disqualifies a
//     token for the whole text.
//
// Together those are not a small shortfall. On Frankenstein the fallback
// recovers `Mr` and `M` (13 and 8 sentences repaired). On Pride and Prejudice
// it recovers NOTHING: `Mr. Darcy` stays at 0 sentences derived, against 249
